Because, as I refactored a little router out from another app, it slowly started to resemble Express/Connect.\n\nAt which point, I thought, \"fuck it, I'll use it anyway.\"\n\nSo, my apologies for yet another router. I decided to call it follow the yellow brick road. Mostly because you'll melt if you use this router.\n\nTo create your router object:\n\n    var router = require('ftybr')();\n\nOnce you've instantiated it, you may add middleware in the connect pattern:\n\n    router.registerMiddleware(function (req, res, done) {\n      // Middleware logic\n    });\n\nYou'll also need to add some routes. To add routes, you'll need to register a controller. Controllers are objects, of some form, that must have a .getRoutes() method. This method returns a multi-dimensional array that is used to build the routes.\n\n    router.registerController({\n      getRoutes: function () [\n        [ 'get', '/', function (req, res) { res.end('woo'); } ]\n      ]\n    });\n\nOnce you've done this, you can then use it as a requestListener within your http server:\n\n    http.createServer(router.requestListener()).listen(8000);\n",
