Because, as I refactored a little router out from another app, it slowly started to resemble Express/Connect.\n\nAt which point, I thought, \"fuck it, I'll use it anyway.\"\n\nSo, my apologies for yet another router. I decided to call it follow the yellow brick road. Mostly because you'll melt if you use this router.\n\nTo create your router object:\n\n    var router = require('ftybr')();\n\nYou'll also need to add some routes. To add routes, you'll need to register a controller. Controllers are objects, of some form, that must have a .getRoutes() method. This method returns a multi-dimensional array that is used to build the routes.\n\n    router.registerController({\n      getRoutes: function () [\n        [ 'get', '/', function (obj, done) { done(null, { output: 'WOO' }); } ]\n      ]\n    });\n\nOnce you've done this, you can then use it as a part of a stream within your requestListener function. See the barnacle-mode module on npm for an idea of how this would work. The idea is that you pipe in an object that contains req as a key and then it pipes onwards to a final stream that then pipes through to res.\n",
