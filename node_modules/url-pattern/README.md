# url-pattern

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/snd/url-pattern.png)](https://travis-ci.org/snd/url-pattern)

url-pattern matches urls with patterns and extracts named url segments

### install

```
npm install url-pattern
```

### use

##### require

```coffeescript
newPattern = require 'url-pattern'
```

##### make pattern from string

```coffeescript
pattern = newPattern '/users/:id'
```

##### make pattern from regex

```coffeescript
regexPattern = newPattern /\/foo\/(.*)/
```

##### match pattern against url

```coffeescript
pattern.match '/projects/5' # => null
pattern.match '/users/5' # => {id: '5'}
pattern.match '/users/foo' # => {id: 'foo'}
```

match returns the extracted parameters or `null` if there was no match

##### match regex pattern against url

```coffeescript
regexPattern.match '/users/foo' # => null
regexPattern.match '/foo/' # => ['']
regexPattern.match '/foo/bar' # => ['bar']
```

if the pattern was created from a regex an array of the captured groups is returned on match.

### pattern examples

`/users` will match exactly `/users`

`/projects/:projectId/supporters/:supporterId` will match any url where the first
segment is `projects`, the second segment is not empty, the third segment is
`supporters` and the fourth segment is not empty. the second and fourth segments will be bound
to `projectId` and `supporterId`

`/projects/*` will match any url which begins with `/projects/`

`*/projects` will match any url which ends with `/projects`

`/users/*/projects` will match any url which starts with `/users/` and ends with `/projects`
