# RimyArseParapet [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/connrs/osioso.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/connrs/node-rimy-arse-parapet)

An anagram for Pipe Array Stream, this module is intended to let you stream multiple arrays with a stream within one of the arrays. The stream within the array will be read before being pushed out as part of the array.

The tests should demonstrate this quite well.

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install rimy-arse-parapet`
